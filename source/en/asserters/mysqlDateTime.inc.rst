.. _mysql-date-time:

mysqlDateTime
*************

It's the assertion dedicated to objects representing MySQL date and based on `DateTime <http://php.net/datetime>`_ object.

Dates must use a format compatible with MySQL and many other DBMSS (database management system), i.e. "Y-m-d H:i:s"

.. note::
   For more information, refer to the documentation of the `date() <http://php.net/date>`_ function from the PHP manual.

If you try to test a value that's not a ``DateTime`` (or a child class) with this assertion it will fail.
